## Overview

The Contrail Test repository contains the test code for validating the Contrail infrastructure
The code is organized into ``fixtures`` and ``scripts``
### fixtures

Contains high level fixtures for creating projects, virtual networks, virtual machines, floating ips, policies, security-groups, service instances, VPCs, VDNS etc. and validate these objects against Contrail components like Contrail API Server, Control nodes, Virtual Routers. 
The fixtures provide ``verify_on_setup()`` and ``verify_on_cleanup()`` methods to achieve this. They also provide some commonly used methods to work with these objects. 
Examples include:
- To run commands on a VM and verify connectivity to it
- Traffic send/receive methods using tools like scapy/netperf 
- Policy rules validation with traffic 
- Perform tcp/icmp/ssh/scp/tftp validations on the VM
- Flow verification for traffic
- Analytics data validation

### scripts

Test scripts at a per-feature level. Sub-folders are created for the features. 
The test scripts can be run on any of the config nodes in the Contrail cluster.  

## Initialization
Install git on the node
```
    $> apt-get install git 
or ::
    $> yum install git
```
Checkout the corresponding branch that the cluster is running ("master","R1.05", "R1.04" etc.)
```
    $> git clone git@github.com:Juniper/contrail-test.git
    $> cd contrail-test
    $> git checkout R1.05
```
Populate the path of this test repo in ``env.test_repo_dir`` in testbed.py (typically /opt/contrail/utils/fabfile/testbeds/testbed.py) 
Refer to ``sanity_params.ini.sample`` for more options. 
Populate the path to the images in ``configs/images.cfg`` 

##Running Tests
Run the 'run_sanity' task in fab 
```
    $> cd /opt/contrail/utils
    $> # Run Sanity test
    $> fab run_sanity
    $> # Run Quick Sanity
    $> fab run_sanity:quick_sanity
```
Run ``fab run_sanity:help`` to view help on running individual tests and other regressions

The run_sanity task installs the python modules required for running tests, autogenerates sanity_params.ini and sanity_testbed.json and sources them for the tests. 
``sanity_testbed.json`` contails the Contrail cluster topology information

To setup fab and learn about testbed.py, please refer to [Contrail Documentation ] (https://techwiki.juniper.net/Documentation/Contrail/Contrail_Controller_Getting_Started_Guide/202Installation)

The log files(with prefix ``test_details.log``) and any html report of the entire run will be created in $HOME/logs/
### Usage:
```
  fab run_sanity[<:feature>[,list]|[,<testcase>]]
  fab run_sanity[:sec_group | :vdns | :multitenancy | :basic_vn_vm | :floating_ip | :svc_mirror | :ecmp | :analytics | :multi_tenancy | :analytics_scale | :webui | :vpc | :performance | :policy | :svc_firewall | :vgw | :evpn | :mx | :discovery | :quick_sanity | :upgrade | :ci_svc_sanity | :webui_sanity | :sanity | :ci_sanity | :regression]
 
  <:feature> is Optional; Default's to <:sanity>
  <:feature><,list> Lists the testcase in the specified <feature> as below,
  mod1.class1.test1
  mod1.class2.test1
  mod2.class1.test1
 
  <:feature><,testcase> Runs the specified <testcase>
  Example:
  fab run_sanity:feature1,mod1.class2.test1
```
### Filing Bugs
Use http://bugs.launchpad.net/juniperopenstack
It will be useful to include the test run log file. 
For post-analysis of a cluster, a fab task ``attach_logs_cores`` can collect the logs and cassandra logs
