## Overview

The Contrail Test repository contains the test code for validating the Contrail infrastructure.
The code is organized into ``fixtures`` , ``scripts`` and ``serial_scripts``.

Testcases under ``scripts`` folder are independent of each other and can be run in parallel.
Testcases under ``serial_scripts`` can have cluster-wide impact and MUST be run only one at a time.

``run_tests.sh`` lets you run these tests as well. Take a look at [ this ](https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-test/wiki/Running-Tests).

### fixtures

Contains high level fixtures for creating projects, virtual networks, virtual machines, floating ips, policies, security-groups, service instances, VPCs, VDNS etc. and validate these objects against Contrail components like Contrail API Server, Control nodes, Virtual Routers. 
The fixtures provide ``verify_on_setup()`` and ``verify_on_cleanup()`` methods to achieve this. They also provide some commonly used methods to work with these objects. 
Examples include:
- To run commands on a VM and verify connectivity to it
- Traffic send/receive methods using tools like scapy/netperf 
- Policy rules validation with traffic 
- Perform tcp/icmp/ssh/scp/tftp validations on the VM
- Flow verification for traffic
- Analytics data validation

### scripts, serial_scripts

Test scripts at a per-feature level. Sub-folders are created for the features. 
The test scripts can be run on any of the config nodes in the Contrail cluster.  

## Initialization
Install git on the node
```
    $> apt-get install git 
or ::
    $> yum install git
```
Checkout the corresponding branch that the cluster is running ("master","R1.05", "R1.04" etc.)
```
    $> git clone git@github.com:Juniper/contrail-test.git
    $> cd contrail-test
    $> git checkout R1.05
```
Populate the path of this test repo in ``env.test_repo_dir`` in testbed.py (typically /opt/contrail/utils/fabfile/testbeds/testbed.py). 
Refer to ``sanity_params.ini.sample`` for more options.
Populate the path to the images in ``configs/images.cfg``.

##Running Tests
Run the 'run_sanity' task in fab:
```
    $> cd /opt/contrail/utils
    $> # Run Sanity test
    $> fab run_sanity
    $> # Run CI Sanity
    $> fab run_sanity:ci_sanity

```
Run ``fab run_sanity:help`` to view help on running individual tests and other regressions.

The run_sanity task installs the python modules required for running tests, autogenerates sanity_params.ini and sanity_testbed.json and sources them for the tests. 
``sanity_testbed.json`` contains the Contrail cluster topology information.

To setup fab and learn about testbed.py, please refer to [Contrail Documentation ] (https://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/contrail1.0/topics/task/installation/testbed-file-vnc.html).

The log files and any html report of the entire run will be created in contrail-test/logs folder.

You can find more detailed information of the [WIKI page] (https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-test/wiki/Running-Tests).

### Usage:
```
  fab run_sanity
  fab run_sanity:ci_sanity
```

### Filing Bugs
Use launchpad [http://bugs.launchpad.net/juniperopenstack](http://bugs.launchpad.net/juniperopenstack) to describe new bugs.

It will be useful to include the test run log file. 

For post-analysis of a cluster, a fab task ``attach_logs_cores`` can collect the logs and cassandra logs.
